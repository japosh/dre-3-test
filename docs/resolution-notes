==== Ineeistent airflow user/role on postgres
-> Identified through compose logs ('role "airflow" does not exist')

line 31 compose.yaml
 environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: admin
 environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: airflow

# [ALT] Create airflow user on postgres
# psql -U admin -d airflow
# CREATE USER airflow WITH PASSWORD 'airflow';
# GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO airflow;
# GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO airflow;

==== Fix volume bind dags
-> Identified before face the issue itself because I made a pre-check on the compose file before run it and saw the mount volume was not mathching with the current dag path on the repository.

line 14 compose.yaml
volumes:
    - ./dag:/opt/airflow/dags
volumes:
    - ./dags:/opt/airflow/dags

==== Fix health check webserver airflow
-> Also identified before the issue itself since the port defined on the URL call didn't make sense, so I adjusted to use the same service exposed port.

line 58 compose.yaml
healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "--fail", "http://localhost:xxxx/health"]
healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "--fail", "http://localhost:8080/health"]

==== Change UID on airflow-common
-> On the airflow-init step I was facing an error related to path permission ownership since the user set didn't have enough permissions to do it and as a consequence I was also facing an error on a DAG run since Airflow was not able to write the log output.

line 17 compose.yaml
user: "5000"
user: "1000"
UID from the user that runs the compose

==== Fix syntax DAG
-> Through the Airflow UI I could see the DAG import error related to a syntax error on the DAG code.
